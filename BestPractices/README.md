# Front-End Best Practices

This repository is opinion-based. The intention of this repository is to serve as living document of my personal best-practices while writing code. This is meant to be a living document and is subject to change.

The notes in this repository are guidelines and should be applied on a general basis. Every project is different and has different use-cases. Use your own judgement to determine if these rules will negatively impact your project.

## General Rules

- Prefer **Typescript** over Javascript
- Use **Yarn** as package installer
- Strive for **80% code coverage** in unit testing
- Include **README.md** files as documentation
